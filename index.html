    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p><em>Effective Date: February 2024</em></p>

    <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
    <p><strong>Camera Access:</strong> We request access to your device's camera solely to allow you to scan physical receipts. Images are processed [locally on your device / on our secure servers] to extract text data.</p>
    <p><strong>Financial Data:</strong> The app extracts data from your receipts (e.g., merchant name, date, total amount). This data is used only to provide the app's core expense-tracking functionality.</p>

    <h3>2. Data Usage & Sharing</h3>
    <p>We do not sell your personal or financial data to third parties. We do not use your receipt data for advertising purposes. Data is only shared with third-party services (like cloud storage) if essential for the app's functionality.</p>

    <h3>3. Data Retention & Deletion</h3>
    <p>We retain your scanned data only as long as your account is active. You may request the permanent deletion of your data at any time by emailing <code>yourname@proton.me</code>. We will fulfill all deletion requests within 30 days.</p>

    <h3>4. Security</h3>
    <p>We use industry-standard encryption (HTTPS/TLS) to protect your data during transmission between your device and our servers.</p>
